/*
You've learned a powerful tool in JavaScript: control flow! It's so powerful, in fact, that it can be used to tell someone's fortune.
In this project we will build the Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.
The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.
